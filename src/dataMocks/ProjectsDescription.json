    "Description":"A Simple UI Clone of Netflix, as always, is more to train the techniques used than actually making a ground-breaking website, still was kind of fun to make this, especially the artwork, which some are custom made to get this Netflix style, most i got from official art, but the Kirby especially the melee ones i made, the latter of which i took the screenshots used. Besides that, i still need to finish, at least the main menu, things like making the card clickable or the responsivity of the site.",
